# Voronoi-Simulation-Using-Cone-Projection
This project simulates the generation of voronoi diagrams. It uses the cone projection approach for approximately computing the regions.

` IMPORTANT: The code is not optimized for handling large number of regions. It is only meant for demonstration purposes.`

# Demo

![Simulation](docs/Simulation.gif)

We created a WebGL application that demonstrates how vornoi regions get created.
A complete demo can be found on [https://omaddam.github.io/Voronoi-Simulation-Using-Cone-Projection/](https://omaddam.github.io/Voronoi-Simulation-Using-Cone-Projection/).
