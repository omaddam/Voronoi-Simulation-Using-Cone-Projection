# Voronoi-Simulation-Using-Cone-Projection
This project simulates the generation of voronoi diagrams. It uses the cone projection approach for approximately computing the regions.

` IMPORTANT: The code is not optimized for handling large number of regions. It is only meant for demonstration purposes.`
